Creating a webpage with Streamlit in Python

Hi there, I'm Andika Andrianto a CS Student.
this time I was given an assignment to play around with Streamlit, and I thought it'd interesting to create my Landing Page with streamlit.


To run streamlit

Open your favourite terminal: 
go to the directory where app.py is

and run the command: streamlit run app.py
